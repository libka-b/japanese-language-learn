A desktop application for learning Japanese language. Built with [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) and vanilla typescript.

Currently lacks distribution via built binaries. To run the application, run the following commands (from the root directory):

```
npm run build
cd src-tauri
cargo run
```

You'll need to have node.js and npm installed as well as rust and cargo.
